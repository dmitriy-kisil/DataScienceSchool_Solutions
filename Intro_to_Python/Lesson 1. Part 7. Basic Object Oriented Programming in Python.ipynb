    "Python is what is known as an object-oriented programming language. This means python allows a programmer to define special custom data structures called classes that not only can contain their own data elements, but special fucntions called methods that can potentially alter a class instance's internal state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are defined through the keyword `class`, followed by the name of the class, which, by convention, is capitalized. This is followed by a code block that specifies the methods that define a class. Note that classes are a rich and complex topic in python. However, much of the functionality a data scientist may wish to use, in particular, python's machine learning libraries, will be accessed through class objects.\n",

    ">* Expand Python `str` type creating a new class `ExStr`. To do this you need inherit `ExStr` from `str`. `ExStr` should contain the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    ">    - `head(n)` - returns the first `n` characters of a string, by default this method should return the first character of the string;\n",
    "\n",
    ">    - `tail(n)` - returns the last `n` characters of a string, by default this method should return the last character of the string;\n",
    "\n",
    ">    - `percentage(flag)` - returns percent of vowels if `flag==True` (by default) and consonants letters otherwise in a string, by default the method shoud search vowels;\n",
    "\n",
    ">    - add magic method `__abs__(self)`, which returns the amount of all characters of a string excluding spaces;\n",
    "\n",
    ">    - add `__eq__(self, other)`, `__ne__(self, other)`, `__lt__(self, other)`, `__gt__(self, other)`, `__le__(self, other)` and `__ge__(self, other)` methods that allows compare two strings based on its length, i.e. 'string' < 'long_string' and 'abc' == 'dog';"
